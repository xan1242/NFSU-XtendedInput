# PROJECT UPDATE

This project will be merged with [NFS_XtendedInput](https://github.com/xan1242/NFS-XtendedInput) and it is currently undergoing a major rewrite.

Any and all issues that curently exist will not be addressed (they will be addressed in the new project instead).

It will take a while before it gets published, so please be patient.

# ORIGINAL README

# Need for Speed Underground & Underground 2 - Xtended Input

This is a plugin for NFS Underground & Underground 2 which brings XInput support to the games!

Currently a work in progress, but fully usable and playable!

For the newer NFS titles by Black Box, check out [NFS_XtendedInput](https://github.com/xan1242/NFS-XtendedInput)

## Features

- Automatic texture and text swapping for button icons - dynamically detects when you use either a keyboard or a controller (Disable Widescreen Fix's button icons to see the effect)

- Choice between Xbox and PS4 icons (from WS Fix)

- Player 2 controls restored

- Console control feature parity (except rumble): restored debug camera analog control

- Access to some leftover features from Hot Pursuit 2

- Re-done keyboard input code - not using DInput8 anymore. Now talks directly over Win32 (GetAsyncKeyState, GetKeyboardState or raw input)

- (UG2 only) Re-done mouse input - also using Win32 for mouse input (with auto hiding after 5 seconds)

## Button mappings

You may remap the buttons in the configuration file (NFSU_XtendedInput.ini), however as of now there is 1 limitation: you may only assign 1 button to an event. Refer to the EventReference.txt file to see what's available.

### About in-game controller settings menu (UG1 only)

You can also remap the buttons via the in-game settings menu. Keep in mind that you'll only be able to remap the buttons visible in that menu (you will not be able to remap FE events).

It does NOT block duplicate mappings, so you *can bind multiple actions to 1 button*.

For keyboards: only the Primary map is bindable and supported. This is subject to change in the future when secondary maps become possible.

For controllers: you may also bind only Primary maps, except for: Steering, Throttle and Brake. Secondary maps for those actions are their digital counterparts exclusively, so they will only respond to buttons. Primary maps for those actions are exclusively analog, so they will only map to analog axis.

To unbind any button: activate an action for rebinding and then press F5. As F5 is the "unbind" button, it is not bindable via the game unto itself. If you wish to bind it, you must edit the configuration file manually.

Any changes made in this menu will be saved to the configuration file.

Default controller button mappings are:

### Ingame

### FrontEnd

Please note that some menus may not advertise their functions properly, but they should be fully functional and controllable like in the console versions.

- Navigation: D-Pad & Left Analog Stick

- Accept: A button

- Back: B button

- Left shoulder & Right shoulder buttons: mapped to their respective equivalents

- L2: Left Trigger

- R2: Right Trigger

- Car orbit: Right Stick

- Button 0: Y

- Button 1: X (used for accessing submenus)

- Help: Right Stick (R3)

- Quit game: Windows/Back button

### Debug camera

You must use a controller on the second port to invoke it and use it

- Activation: Windows/Back

- Move forward: A button

- Move backward: Y button

- Move left: X button

- Move right: B button

- Move up: Left Shoulder

- Move down: Left Trigger

- Look up/down/left/right: D-Pad

- Turbo: Right Shoulder

- Super Turbo: Right Trigger

- Movement (analog): Left Stick X/Y

- Look (analog): Right stick X/Y

- Drop car: Start

## Keyboard controls

They're slightly changed from default.

Also the second player can be controlled with another keyboard (raw input mode only).

The first used keyboard will be assigned to the first player (and subsequently the second one to the second player)

By default it'll use GetAsyncKeyState (unbuffered) to read keys which might cause some issues with other hooks to the WndProc of this game, but will deliver the most optimal performance. A key's status is being read as it's being scanned in this mode.

Second mode is GetKeyboardState (buffered). This will store all keys in a buffer and read them during ActualReadJoystickData (which starts right before eDisplayFrame). Use this if you have some issues.

Third mode is raw input reading. This is read during WM_INPUT. It currently exhibits mediocre performance due to the implementation, but allows for differentiating between different keyboards. Use this if you really need it.

## Windows 7 compatibility

To use in Windows 7 (and maybe Vista & XP), you need to use the "Win7" builds.

Requirements are:

- [Xbox 360 Controller Driver](https://archive.org/details/xbox-360-64-engwin-7)

- [DirectX Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) (for XInput 9.1.0)

- [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) (2019 is used by ASI Loader, 2015 is used by XtendedInput, both are included in the installation package)

This was tested on a Pentium 3 machine running Windows 7 and it is fully working.

These builds are made with SSE instructions enabled (and other extensions disabled), so it should also work on Athlon XP as well.

The release package comes with a special build of ASI loader which is made without any CPU extensions required. It is also patched to work in Windows XP.

These builds may or may not work in Windows XP with some hacks, YMMV as it wasn't tested. Follow the instructions found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) to find out more. TLDR: "The last version of the Visual C++ Redistributable that works on Windows XP shipped in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.7 (file versions starting withÂ **14.27**)."

- Check the top of the source file

- Currently KILLS Direct Input, beware
